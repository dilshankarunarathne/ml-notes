# Machine Learning 

<pre>
Machine Learning, is the field of study that gives computers the ability 
to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from 
experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance 
measure P - if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

### Supervised learning

With this given data set, we can use a liner, quadratic or any other 
algorithm to presume the value of a certain house based on it's size.   
This is a good example of **supervised learning**. We give the algorithm 
a dataset
